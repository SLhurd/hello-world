hello-world
===========

And this great trek begins.

Pugs are cute, but
Python is a much better way to dominate the coding world.
I have completed the Codecademy Python course.
I have a background in programming other languages, including Javascript.
I have completed and have a certification for the Coursera Python course for data analysis.
As a refresher, I am working through the Javascript code on codecademy,
also while working on Python skills on the codingbat.com site.
